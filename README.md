# Mini Project 1.2

This project creates only the front end for a electronics device store. It features a header with a logo, navigation bar, and shopping cart icon. The product listing displays at least eight items, each with an image, details, price, and an "Add to Cart" button, using Flexbox for alignment and hover effects. A flexible "About Us" section and a footer with contact information and social media links are also included. The entire site is built using Flexbox for responsive design and adheres to CSS BEM naming conventions for maintainable styling.
